      "The 2020s should be the Sustainability Decade for the Irish agri-food sector.  After eighteen months of work, this is the \n",
      "conclusion of the 2030 Agri-Food Strategy Committee. The Strategy that follows explains why this conclusion was reached \n",
      "and what needs to be done for Ireland to become an international leader in Sustainable Food Systems (SFSs).\n",
      "\n",
      "A Sustainable Food System is profitable throughout \n",
      "(economic sustainability), has broad-based benefits \n",
      "for society (social sustainability) and has a positive \n",
      "or neutral impact on the natural environment \n",
      "(environmental sustainability).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Stakeholder Committee’s terms of reference \n",
      "were to develop a new Strategy for the Irish agri-food \n",
      "sector that would outline the vision and key objectives, \n",
      "with associated actions, to ensure its economic, \n",
      "environmental and social sustainability to 2030. It \n",
      "took a crucial early decision that the Strategy should \n",
      "be developed using a ‘food systems’ approach. This \n",
      "recognises the interconnectedness between policies \n",
      "for food, environment and health; and acknowledges \n",
      "that each actor in the food chain, from farm to fork, \n",
      "has an important role in developing a sustainable \n",
      "food system. Adopting this approach represents a \n",
      "significant change in direction by comparison to the \n",
      "four previous agri-food strategies developed since \n",
      "2000, albeit acknowledging important continuities \n",
      "with these earlier strategies.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The key to leadership in Sustainable Food Systems \n",
      "is to achieve a genuine balance between the three \n",
      "dimensions of sustainability. At the heart of the \n",

      "sustainable food and drink, as well as other natural \n",
      "resource based products and services associated with \n",
      "the sector. Most of the growth in population over the \n",

      "\n",
      "In my view, the debate between agricultural \n",
      "and environmental interest groups has become \n",
      "excessively polarised in Ireland. In February 2021, the \n",
      "Environmental Pillar representative withdrew from \n",
      "the 2030 Stakeholder Committee, stating their view \n",
      "that the Pillar’s recommendations were insufficiently \n",

      "of regret to the Committee, all the more so given the \n",

      "up to that point. The Strategy in its final form has, in \n",
      "the view of the Committee, recommended policies to \n",
      "achieve a balance between economic, environmental \n",

      "It signals policies to make the sector more diversified, \n",

      "expansion in nature-based production systems, tillage, \n",
      "horticulture and organic production. But the core \n",
      "of Ireland’s agri-food output should continue to be \n",
      "grass-based livestock production. Worldwide, but \n",
      "particularly in high-income countries, more fruits and \n",
      "vegetables and less ultra-processed foods should be \n",
      "consumed in the interest of public health. But this does \n",
      "not mean that Ireland should make radical changes \n",
      "from its role as a producer and exporter of safe, high \n",
      "quality and sustainably produced livestock products: \n",
      "this would not make sense from a global environmental \n",
      "or nutrition perspective, nor an economic perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2030 Strategy represents a continuation of the \n",
      "journey of transition the sector has experienced \n",
      "over the past seventy years. In the 1950s, Ireland’s \n",
