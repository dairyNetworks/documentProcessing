      "A.2 Key Concepts\n",
      "A.2.1 What drives energy demand?\n",
      "As introduced in section 3.1, people do not want energy itself, but rather the services, like mobility, heating and cooking,\n",
      "that energy provides. These are often referred to as energy service demands. Factors that can influence the level of demand\n",
      "include the weather, costs, efficiency, technology/fuel choice and the state of the economy (SEAI, 2021c). Energy supply\n",
      "responds to the level of demand for energy services (heating, transportation and electricity) and how end-users want\n",
      "that energy demand satisfied. Energy service demand is driven primarily by economic activity and by the energy end-use\n",
      "technologies employed in undertaking such activity.\n",
      "For example, population growth impacts the number of homes we need, which has a rolling impact on the amount of\n",
      "heating, cooking and lighting demand. The amount of energy used in the home will then largely be depend on energy\n",
      "performance of the building/technologies in it, followed by the cost of fuel and household income. In addition, where these\n",
      "homes are located will also influence the number of kilometres people move and travel each year, which feeds into transport\n",
      "energy demand. Heating and transport demand is thus also linked to the density of our settlement patterns in terms of\n",
      "access to services (i.e. how far we travel to work, school or shops) and size of homes.\n",
      "A.2.1.1 Economic activity\n",
      "Generally, the larger an economy, the greater the level of energy demand. GDP is the most widely accepted measure of\n",
      "economic activity internationally. Historically, there has been a very close relationship between a country’s GDP and its energy\n",
      "demand as a country develops. Industrialisation driven by fossil fuels meant there was a close link between the profits of\n",
      "companies and energy demand. However, more recently, there has been a significant move to less energy-intense forms of\n",
      "economic activity, which means that the relationship is no longer as clear.\n",
      "The relationship between economic activity and energy demand in Ireland is particularly complex. A large share of our GDP\n",
      "comes from the activity of large multinationals that demand little energy relative to the very large amount of value added in\n",
      "sectors such as pharmaceuticals, technology and, in particular, services28. In contrast, an industrialised nation, like Germany,\n",
      "that produces energy-intensive heavy goods and machinery for export (cars, computers, chemicals) currently requires large\n",
      "amounts of fossil fuels in production and transportation.\n",
      "The mismatch in Ireland between the economic activity of these companies that results in large amounts of value added (i.e.\n",
      "profits) and the very little energy demand was clearly illustrated in 2015, when GDP increased suddenly by 25% from 2014,\n",
      "due to the transfer of intellectual property from multinational companies (SEAI, 2022c). This demonstrates that care must be\n",
      "taken when comparing macro-economic indicators, such as energy demand per unit GDP. To address this issue, the CSO have\n",
      "developed alternative indicators to GDP.\n",
      "Modified gross national income is an adjustment to gross national income designed specifically to measure the size of the\n",
      "Irish economy (Central Statistics Office, 2022a). It subtracts depreciation on two kinds of assets to exclude globalisation\n",
      "effects: intellectual property and leased aircraft. In addition, it excludes the income of redomiciled public limited companies.\n",
      "These are companies with a permanent office here, meeting the criteria for being an Irish resident. However, their board\n",
      "members do not usually work in Ireland and the companies conduct little or no real activity in Ireland.\n",
      "Another alternative indicator is modified domestic demand. While modified gross national income approaches GDP from\n",
      "income perspective, modified domestic demand approaches it from an expenditure perspective (Central Statistics Office,\n",
      "2022b). It is a measure of expenditure in the country less some large transactions from foreign companies that have\n",
      "little impact on the domestic economy, such as trade by aircraft-leasing companies, exports and imports of research and\n",
      "development services, and exports and imports of R&D-related intellectual property rights (Central Statistics Office, 2022b).\n",
      "Modified domestic demand therefore results in a smaller number than GDP, and more truly reflects what Irish homes,\n",
      "business and government are doing. For example, Ireland’s modified domestic demand grew by 5.3% from 2014 to 2015,\n",
      "compared with 25% for GDP (SEAI, 2020a).\n",

      "This was due to the implementation of energy efficiency measures, and switching from energy-intensive industry, such as\n",
      "construction, steel and fertiliser production, to higher value products, such as pharmaceuticals (Andreoni, 2020).\n",
      "Between 2014 and 2019, the transport sector was the largest energy demand in Ireland (section 3.2), but in 2020 it fell\n",

      "both global and local solutions. Ireland has a large agricultural sector relative to the overall\n",
      "economy with agricultural emissions accounting for a disproportionately large portion (32.3%) of\n",
      "our total national emissions, which is projected to increase. There is therefore an urgent need to\n",
      "reduce GHG emissions in agriculture while simultaneously improving farm incomes to ensure the\n",
      "delivery of sustainable livelihoods across Ireland and a healthy natural environment. A thriving\n",
      "agricultural sector is not fundamentally at odds with effective climate mitigation outcomes, with\n",
      "efficient and sustainable agricultural production playing a key role in a low carbon society.\n",
      "The role of the State must be to encourage innovation and diversity in the sector and ensure that\n",
      "policies and incentives are aligned with, rather than contrary to, meeting the climate change goals\n",
      "of the State. Farmers and landowners, as custodians of the land, and as those who may be\n",
      "impacted most severely by climate change, have an intimate knowledge of and actively manage\n",
      "the land and will drive solutions forward.\n",
      "Climate change is already having adverse impacts on Irish agriculture, altering the use of land and\n",
      "changing the timing of natural events. The negative impacts for soils, water, biodiversity,\n",
      "vegetation and wildlife are likely to be significant. Recent fodder crises and extreme weather\n",
      "events are evidence of the severe pressures being placed on the sector.\n",
      "Emissions from soils due to agriculture, forestry, peatland drainage and peat extraction are a major\n",
      "element of Irish emissions. Conversely, the restoration of soils to carbon sequestering status can\n",
      "both prevent these emissions and (more slowly) start to reabsorb carbon. Similarly, appropriate\n",
      "afforestation, forest management and use of forest products can lead to carbon sequestration and\n",

      "assessment of the vulnerability of all critical infrastructure (including energy, transport,\n",
      "built environment, water and communications) with a view to building resilience to\n",
      "ongoing climate change and extreme weather events. The outcome of this assessment\n",
      "should be implemented. Recognising the significant costs that the State would bear in\n",
      "the event of failure of critical infrastructure, spending on infrastructure should be\n",
      "prioritised to take account of this.\n",

      "associated with a failure to act.\n",
      "II. Steps should be taken to reduce packaging, particularly plastic packaging, and resulting\n",
      "waste. Suggestions for such steps include the eradication of single use plastics particularly\n",
      "in supermarkets and the imposition of penalties for failure to comply and the introduction of\n",
      "a deposit return scheme on plastic bottles.\n",
      "III. The agriculture sector in Ireland requires ongoing support to make a transition towards\n",
      "models of production which give rise to lower GHG emissions. Cognisance must be taken\n",
      "of the impact which the sector has on the economy, particularly the rural economy.\n",

      "Context\n",
      "Over the past century, there is evidence to suggest that Ireland, like the rest of the globe, has\n",
      "warmed. The information appears to suggest that “[c]hanges at the regional level contain more\n",
      "variability than changes in the global mean, yet an emerging signal of change is clear”.23 The recent\n",
      "weather events in Ireland, particularly Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma, further underline the impact\n",
      "of extreme climate events for agriculture and their potential frequency in the years and decades\n",
      "ahead. The Stop Climate Chaos Coalition highlighted how this challenge has already manifested\n",
      "itself:\n",
      "“In fact, agriculture is particularly dependent on a stable climate. In recent years we\n",
      "have seen this in the damage done by flooding and the fodder crisis and, in recent days,\n",
      "by the damage done by the combination of Storm Emma and the “beast from the east”.\n",
      "All these extreme weather events are made more likely by global warming”.24\n",
      "Agricultural emissions are classed as non-ETS emissions, meaning that they cannot be traded\n",
      "through the EU’s Emissions Trading System. While this underlines the challenge of reducing\n",
      "emissions, this classification of emissions also raises a number of points on how emissions are\n",
      "accounted for, how they are calculated, whether they are measured at the point of production or\n",
      "consumption and whether the system used is fair to Member States of differing economic\n",
      "structures. Examples of emissions that can be traded (ETS emissions) include emissions from the\n",
      "generation of heat and electricity, and commercial aviation.\n",
      "Mitigation\n",
      "Mitigation refers to measures aimed at alleviating the impact of emissions and other causes of\n",
      "climate change. Most notably, this includes the aim of reducing GHG emissions as required under\n",
      "the Paris Agreement, but can also include the development of measures to:\n",
      "- improve carbon sequestration;\n",
      "- develop carbon sinks such as soils; and\n",
      "- increase production efficiency in industries which are sources of emissions.\n",
      "Adaptation\n",
      "Adaptation refers to the process of adapting to new climatic conditions resulting from climate\n",
      "change. In contrast to mitigation, the Committee notes that this course of action accepts climate\n",

      "In concluding this report, the Committee has examined the climate change issue in great detail,\n",
      "highlighting the scale of the problem, the comparison with other Member States, the scope for\n",
      "improvement, but also the importance of agri-food to the economy and in bolstering international\n",
      "trade. While there have been significant efforts from the agri-food sector as a whole, there is scope\n",
      "for further improvements to be made.\n",
      "Agriculture is the largest contributor to Irish GHG emissions and while the point has been made that\n",
      "it is more challenging to lower emissions in that sector, there is scope for further improvements. A\n",
      "number of options exist, including forestry, organic farming, increased production efficiencies and\n",
      "current initiatives such as Origin Green. It is highly likely the next CAP will play an important role as\n",
      "well. However, balancing increased production with lower emissions is a very substantial challenge,\n",
      "and the Committee believes that an impact assessment of Food Wise 2025 must be very important.\n",
      "In line with the economic challenges, most notably Brexit, the issue of emissions could have\n",
      "significant long-term consequences.\n",
      "Some of the consequences are already apparent, with the impact of heatwaves and winter storms\n",
      "both recently felt by farmers and the rural community. The need for early intervention is clear.\n",
      "Measures such as EU funding, Exchequer funding and schemes managed by the Department should\n",
      "be implemented. Additionally, support from expertise, the development of logistical channels and\n",
      "enhanced scientific and business supports should be of assistance.\n",
      "There is much concern in the level of emissions coming from the livestock sector. However, unlike\n",
      "other sectors, the long-term goal is carbon neutrality. Already, very substantive programmes have\n",
      "been implemented, with particular focus in this report on Origin Green, Dairy Sustainability Ireland\n",
      "and the Smart Farming Programme. As research and knowledge develops, further opportunities\n",
      "measures and supports for addressing the level of emissions can also be developed. While Ireland is\n",
      "already demonstrating high levels of efficiency, there is always scope for improvement as technology\n",
      "develops and there is also scope to share this level of knowledge and efficiency more widely. There\n",
      "may also be merit in exploring Cross-border co-operation on reducing emissions.\n",
      "Science too has a role to play, and initiatives such as the Beef Data Genomics Programme, as well as\n",
      "the potential of seaweed additives may mitigate climate change impacts. The Carbon Navigator is\n",
      "another tool that the Committee believes is vitally important in assessing the impact of farming on\n",
      "the environment at an individual level.\n",
      "GHG emissions are not just confined to enteric fermentation. The Committee considered agricultural\n",
      "soils and manure management as a source of emissions, and believes a Climate Activation\n",
      "Programme enhancing existing schemes and including new incentives for the farming community\n",
      "should be explored. Simple actions such as the greater use of lime could have a beneficial impact on\n",
      "soil quality and the capacity of soils to store carbon. An area of particular interest, is the\n",
      "development of anaerobic digestion to a much greater level. This offers a means of producing an\n",
      "energy resource in biogas, with the by-product forming a nutrient-rich fertiliser.\n",
      "There are also less obvious ways in which this sector could offer value, such as the potential of\n",
      "bioplastics and beekeeping as well as the planting of specific crops. Bioplastics offer a product that is\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 60:\n",
      "compostable, potentially addressing the challenges currently posed by conventional plastics.\n",
      "Enhancing beekeeping acknowledges an issue that may become more important in the years ahead,\n",
      "as plant life is heavily dependent on pollination.\n",
      "In addition to the scope for mitigating emissions, the Committee noted that agriculture is the only\n",
      "sector that can sequester emissions through storing carbon. The primary methods explored in this\n",
      "report are forestry, agroforestry and grasslands. Central to this is the encouragement of biodiversity,\n",
      "with some specific recommendations such as conservation agriculture and the use of mixed swards\n",
      "and clover.\n",
      "The marine sector has not been forgotten, and the Committee has examined issues on the level of\n",
      "plastics, ocean acidification, the possible economic opportunities and the potential implications from\n",
      "the decline in certain stocks. There is a strong relationship between the agriculture, food and marine\n",
      "sectors, with the ocean playing a substantial role in our climate.\n",
      "Finally, as the climate change issue evolves, the challenges and potential solutions should remain\n",

      "The Committee strongly believes that the Nitrates Derogation should be maintained at\n",
      "its current level, as it is clear from the evidence provided to the Committee that\n",
      "economic and social implications which would arise from a further decrease to the\n",

      "EPA, which indicates that in recent times, there has been no change in the biological\n",
      "quality of our rivers and lakes and that the improvements regarding nitrates in some\n",
      "areas are being offset by declines in other areas.111\n",
      "The Committee notes that, for the purposes of the Water Framework Directive, “the\n",
      "overall water quality in Ireland is relatively good when compared to other EU\n",
      "countries,” in that “over half (54%) of surface water bodies have satisfactory (good or\n",

      "9.2. Recommendations\n",
      "1. The Committee recommends that the Government should establish an inter-\n",
      "departmental taskforce, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, to\n",
      "properly assess the economic and social implications of a further reduction to\n",
      "the Nitrates Derogation. The taskforce should also include representatives from\n",
      "the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of\n",
      "Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Enterprise, Trade\n",
      "and Employment, the Department of Rural and Community Development, and\n",
      "relevant state agencies.\n",
      "2. The Committee recommends that there should be a move from the present\n",
      "principal elements of Ireland’s Nitrates Action Programme towards a tailored\n",
      "catchment-based approach.\n",
      "3. The Committee recommends that the Government should ensure that the\n",
      "Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme is adequately\n",
      "supported and resourced, as it is evident that when support and advice of this\n",
      "nature is provided to farmers, positive results will follow.\n",
      "4. The Committee notes that there are approximately 137,000 farmers in Ireland,\n",
      "of which approximately 43,000 receive advice from Teagasc, approximately\n",
      "55,000 receive advice from private consultants and advisers, and\n",
      "approximately 30,000 do not receive support from an adviser. The Committee\n",
      "recommends that additional funding and support should be made available to\n",
      "agricultural consultants and advisers, where relevant in the context of the\n",
      "Nitrates Directive, and regardless of whether they are state-funded or privately\n",
      "funded, to ensure that all farmers are being adequately supported in terms of\n",
      "advice.\n",

      "in terms of demonstrating decreases in nutrient concentration in our water\n",

      "bodies. On this basis, the Committee recommends that research should be\n",
      "undertaken by the Government which would illustrate estimated lag times in the\n",
      "context of nitrates reduction measures, which can be used during negotiations\n",
      "for the renewal of Ireland’s Nitrates Derogation. Furthermore, the Committee\n",
      "notes that a total of 39 additional measures were transposed into Statutory\n",
      "Instruments relating to the Nitrates Action Programme since 2020, and the fact\n",
      "that these measures will take time to show results should be strongly\n",

      "6. The Committee notes that there appears to be an information gap in the\n",
      "measures that are being undertaken at farm level and the corresponding results\n",
      "in the water environment. On this basis, the Committee recommends that\n",
      "resources currently provided to Teagasc to undertake research and knowledge\n",
      "transfer in this regard through the Agricultural Catchments Programme be\n",
      "complemented with permanent posts and employment terms. Currently, the\n",

      "examine the use of the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund, also\n",

      "slurry storage project, in the context of climate adaptation.\n",

      "10. The Committee recommends that annual training for all farmers, with a specific\n",
      "focus on improving water quality, should be introduced and should be funded\n",
      "by the Government. Furthermore, farmers should be incentivised by the\n",
      "Government to participate in such training. The Committee envisages that this\n",

      "additional personnel that are required to ensure that these targets are achieved,\n",
      "only 27 of the relevant positions have been filled, to date. The Committee\n",

      "consistent in their approach and that breaches of the regulations are dealt with\n",
      "fairly and in accordance with the Farmers’ Charter of Rights.\n",

      "that all farmers can ensure that their cattle are restricted from entering water\n",

      "additional supports should be put in place to ensure that appropriate buffer\n",
      "zones exist between grazing land and water bodies, and to ensure that drinkers\n",
      "are placed in suitable areas, away from water bodies, where possible.\n",

      "phosphorus originating from humans and animals as regards the trophic status\n",
      "of Ireland’s water bodies. In this regard, the Committee is concerned that\n",
      "Ireland’s wastewater treatment plants are not adequately resourced.\n",
      "Furthermore, the Committee understands that forestry is the third most\n",
      "significant pressure on water quality in Ireland. Considering these points, the\n",

      "The Climate Act 2015 provides a legal definition for adaptation as “adjustment to (a) any system designed or operated by\n",
      "human beings, including an economic, agricultural or technological system, or (b) any naturally occurring system, including\n",
      "an ecosystem, that is intended to counteract the effects (whether actual or anticipated) of climatic stimuli, prevent or\n",

      "systems and highlight their interconnected nature and co-dependency. IPCC Working Group II (WGII) Sixth Assessment\n",
      "Report (AR6) defines adaptation in human systems as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects,\n",
      "in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, adaptation is defined as the process of\n",
      "adjustment to actual climate and its effects (Ara Begum et al., 2022). For natural systems, human intervention may facilitate\n",
      "adjustment to expected climate and its effects. According to the IPCC (2022), adaptation is often associated with five\n",
      "general stages: awareness, assessment, planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (Ara Begum et al., 2022).\n",
      "Responsibility for adaptation falls to a range of actors, including governmental, non-governmental, private sector, community\n",
      "and individual actors. In Ireland, adaptation actions have tended, thus far, to be focused on governmental actors; however,\n",

      "1.3.2. Risk, hazard, exposure and vulnerability\n",
      "Key to understanding and implementing adaptation are the interrelated concepts of risk, exposure and vulnerability. Risk\n",
      "signifies the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems (Ara Begum et al., 2022) and originates\n",
      "from a combination of social processes and their interaction with the environment (Cardona et al., 2012). In the context\n",
      "of climate change, risks emerge from the dynamic interactions between climate change (changing average conditions\n",
      "and variability) and related hazards (e.g. heatwaves, floods, droughts, etc.), exposure and vulnerability (see Figure 1.5).\n",
      "Importantly, climate change is not the sole driver of risk, with adverse outcomes in good part determined by the vulnerability\n",
      "and exposure of societies, infrastructure and ecosystems (Birkmann, 2006; Cardona et al., 2012). Moreover, risk is not fixed\n",
      "but is dynamic and in constant evolution, as the frequency and intensity of hazards change with climate change and as\n",
      "exposure and vulnerability change through many drivers. Both exposure and vulnerability are also highly context specific. As a\n",
      "result, adaptation needs to be seen as not as a single intervention fixed in time, but a process that responds to the dynamics\n",
      "and evolution of risk. This is the idea of adaptation as iterative risk management (Ara Begum et al., 2022), whereby emphasis\n",

      "adaptation. Research shows that soft barriers to adaptation emerge from neglecting place-based values, a lack of input from\n",
      "affected communities, shortcomings and failures in governance, and a lack of financial resources. Without considering these\n",
      "important social aspects of adaptation there is a risk that adaptation can become contested and result in maladaptation or\n",
      "unwanted outcomes or that adaptation will not take place. Most research in Ireland to date has focused on modelling and\n",
      "assessment of future climate impacts. This needs to be supplemented with research into the social science dimensions of\n",
      "adaptation. This also has salience in ensuring that adaptation is just and equitable.\n",
      "1.7.2. Knowledge for informing adaptation\n",
      "No systematic assessment of climate change impacts has been undertaken across sectors using the same climate change\n",
      "projections or the same socioeconomic or socioecological scenarios. While advances in the development of a consistent set\n",
      "of climate projections for Ireland are forthcoming from the TRANSLATE project (O’Brien and Nolan, 2023), it is essential that\n",
      "these projections are used to assess climate change impacts across sectors in advance of the next cycle of climate adaptation\n",
      "plans. The implications of this lack of systematic assessment are evident throughout Volume 3, in that little research has been\n",
      "undertaken for some sectors and considerably more for others.\n",
      "In addition to climate change impact assessments, novel approaches to informing adaptation are emerging in the\n",
      "international literature. Key among these is the development of adaptation storylines, which take advantage of memorable\n",
      "historical extremes, together with process understanding and climate model projections, to leverage insight into discussions\n",
      "of vulnerability, risk and adaptation responses. Such approaches have much to offer, especially in understanding cascading\n",
      "risks and interdependencies, which are an underexplored aspect of adaptation in Ireland to date.\n",
      "Adaptation, at its core, is about reducing vulnerability. In addition, the outcomes of adaptation need to be tracked relative to\n",
      "their impact on vulnerability. Little research has explored current and future vulnerability, and this should be highlighted as a\n",
      "core component of the knowledge necessary to inform adaptation. If adaptation reduces climate risks, then knowledge of\n",
      "how hazards and disruptions are likely to change is just one part of the equation, as we also need a fuller understanding of\n",
      "vulnerability and exposure. In addition, how to deploy these tools for evaluating adaptation actions and options, rather than\n",

      "(3) a lack of historical data on the spatial extents of key habitats, which further undermines the ability to analyse species’\n",
      "interdependencies. To address these limitations, Donnelly (2018) highlights the importance of identifying key species and\n",
      "habitats, both vulnerable and resilient to climate change, to establish a multi-trophic monitoring programme. This type of\n",
      "programme could also be adapted to incorporate direct and indirect impacts of climate change, such as determining how\n",
      "rising temperature may impact phenology and range shifts directly, and how changes in the physical environment resulting\n",
      "from climate change may feed back to organisms.\n",

      "Research and modelling of marine food webs is necessary to understand their level of vulnerability and how they are\n",
      "responding to climate change and to establish a baseline for MPAs.\n",

      "As covered in more detail in Chapter 3 (sections 3.4 and 3.5), land use management options to increase biodiversity\n",
      "on farmland and forestry can improve the outlook for Ireland. This includes more species-rich grasslands, improving\n",

      "understand trophic interactions and tackle the threat of phenological mismatches. The importance of healthy plant\n",
      "biodiversity to reduce phenological mismatches should be recognised.\n",

      "5.6.2. Enhanced monitoring\n",
      "Monitoring is essential to track emerging signals of change, the changing nature of risk (including losses from extreme events\n",

      "has an extensive hydrometric network for monitoring water levels and discharge, networks for other key variables need to\n",
      "be developed and maintained. For example, investment in the Agricultural Catchments Programme by Teagasc has led to\n",
      "new insights into how climate, catchment characteristics, land management and agricultural practices affect water quality.\n",
      "Expansion of such intensive monitoring programmes to other locations would be of high value to adaptation for a range\n",
      "of sectors. Monitoring of key variables for water quality is often of short duration and linked to the duration of research\n",

      "7.1. Introduction\n",
      "‘Critical infrastructure’ refers to the array of physical assets, functions and systems that are vital to ensuring the health,\n",
      "wealth and security of a nation (Forzieri et al., 2018). Critical infrastructure provides services considered necessary for the\n",
      "routine functioning of a modern society. While slow degradation or depreciation of critical infrastructure may not immediately\n",
      "lead to degradation in the associated services, it increases the probability of a sudden failures within these key networks.\n",
      "The definition above is largely carried through in the strategic emergency management guidelines for critical infrastructure,\n",
      "which consider how such issues would have a significant impact in the State as a result of failure to maintain those functions\n",
      "(Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, 2021). The NAF lists the water, energy, communications, transport and\n",
      "emergency services as critical infrastructure sectors at risk from sea level rise, flooding and climate extremes (DECC, 2018,\n",
      "p. 29). While attentive to broader pictures of critical infrastructure, this chapter examines solely transport, energy, and\n",
      "information and communications technology (ICT). Water provision and wastewater are covered in Chapter 5, and flooding is\n",
      "covered further in Chapters 5, 6, 8 and 9.\n",
      "A characteristic of critical infrastructure is that it is possible to identify and list each individual piece. For Ireland, this is done\n",
      "by Hawchar et al. (2020), focusing on the four key sectors of transport, energy, water and ICT. These same four sectors were\n",
      "also taken to be the main repository of critical national infrastructure by the CIViC (Critical Infrastructure Vulnerability to\n",
      "Climate Change) project (Ryan, P. et al., 2021), which is the most substantial research project in Ireland to date on climate\n",
      "change and critical infrastructure.\n",
      "Climate-related risks to critical infrastructure assets are a function of hazards, vulnerability and exposure. Some assets may\n",
      "be highly critical, meaning that the consequences of failure are significant. They may, however, have low vulnerabilities to\n",
      "climate hazards, meaning that their overall climate risk is low. This emphasises the importance of considering the three\n",
      "essential components of risk. It is also important to note that many pieces of critical infrastructure are dependent on\n",
      "other infrastructure to operate (Dawson et al., 2018). Consequently, seemingly resilient infrastructure can be vulnerable\n",
      "to cascading failures from other critical infrastructure sectors. Thus, it is important to consider interdependencies between\n",
      "sectors when assessing critical infrastructure risks. The Irish Academy of Engineering (2009) report on critical infrastructure\n",
      "adaptation focused on water supply, flood alleviation and energy, and recommended a series of planning, management,\n",
      "information and engineering measures that are broadly consistent with the thrust of this report.\n",
      "A much more expansive concept of key infrastructure was taken by the IPCC WGII AR6, chapter 6 (Dodman et al., 2022),\n",
      "to include social institutions and networks and nature-based amenities, as well as physical, engineered assets. This chapter\n",
      "focuses exclusively on the climate change risks to the four key critical infrastructure sectors in Ireland and on how such\n",

      "7.1.1. Adapting critical infrastructure\n",
      "Critical infrastructure should be routinely maintained, frequently upgraded and ideally engineered to have sufficient resilience\n",
      "to operate within the full range of weather situations that are likely to arise in both current and future expected climates. The\n",
      "phrase ‘likely to arise’ can be quantified by choosing specific percentiles or occurrence frequencies for weather parameters\n",
      "such as temperature, precipitation and wind. More detailed assessment can also be completed using a quantitative risk\n",
      "analysis that incorporates uncertainty and variability at each assessment phase, as will be discussed later in this chapter.\n",
      "Weather and climate data are available (Nolan, 2015; Nolan and Flanagan, 2020) to assess the occurrence frequency of\n",
      "weather parameters with a quantifiable confidence level. Note, however, that the overall risk to any infrastructure asset\n",
      "depends on the vulnerability of the asset as well as on weather hazards.\n",
      "Climate change, whether in the form of more extreme weather events or simply a shift in average conditions, is now a\n",
      "reality that needs to be factored into the overall design of critical infrastructure, including its location, capacity, versatility\n",
      "and operational range, and other resilience features. Quantitative projections out to 2100 by Forzieri et al. (2018) found that\n",
      "the cost of infrastructure damage within Europe caused by extreme events attributed to climate change is likely to increase\n",
      "from 2018 levels of €3.4 billion per year to triple that amount during the 2030s, six times by 2050 and 10 times by 2100.\n",
      "The main hazards causing these damages are expected to be heatwaves, droughts and coastal flooding, but also inland\n",
      "flooding, windstorms and forest fires. These increased hazards (and consequent infrastructural damage) are expected to be\n",
      "concentrated in southern and eastern Europe. Moreover, those projections were based on ‘business-as-usual’ or Late action\n",
      "on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, which are not necessarily the most likely. While the semi-quantitative analysis by\n",
      "Forzieri et al. (2018) provides a useful high-level assessment of projected European-scale infrastructure damage, it cannot\n",
      "substitute for full quantitative analysis of asset-level vulnerability.\n",
      "Dawson et al. (2018) list four strategies to manage climate change risks to critical infrastructure:\n",
      "1. protect the infrastructure to reduce likelihood of failure;\n",
      "2. improve component performance, so assets can operate under a wider range of conditions;\n",
      "3. provide redundancy (back-up systems, increased capacity, more diverse components, alternative routings);\n",
      "4. train people and provide the technology needed to respond to, and recover from, infrastructure disruption.\n",
      "For Ireland, the CIViC report (Ryan, P. et al., 2021) highlighted the need to better understand critical infrastructure networks\n",
      "and the importance of moving towards a more quantitative risk-based analysis for examining climate change impacts and\n",
      "climate adaptation. Quantitative risk analysis can inform effective adaptation in the face of considerable uncertainty and\n",
      "variability, thus avoiding the opportunity costs associated with risk neglect, worst-case thinking and risk aversion. Resilient\n",
      "infrastructures may be characterised by their ability to anticipate and absorb disruption, adapt and transform themselves in\n",
      "response to external changes, recover quickly and learn from past experiences (Mehvar et al., 2021).\n",
      "7.2. Risks, vulnerabilities and impacts\n",
      "Forzieri et al. (2018) conducted a comprehensive high-level semi-quantitative assessment of risk to critical infrastructure\n",
      "across Europe due to climate change under a ‘Late action’ future emissions scenario. Risk was quantified as a combination\n",
      "of hazard, asset exposure and sensitivity. Future risks were extrapolated from costs and damage caused by recent extreme\n",
      "weather events. Seven primary hazards were identified (heatwaves, cold waves, droughts, coastal floods, river floods,\n",
      "windstorms and wildfires), with risks calculated over four infrastructural sectors (energy, transport, industry and social). Of the\n",
      "hazards listed, only cold waves (and their associated costs) are projected to decrease in the coming decades. Damage caused\n",
      "by windstorms, river floods and wildfires is projected to increase (from 10% to 100%, relative to the 1981–2010 baseline\n",
      "period). Specific estimates are for windstorm costs to critical infrastructure to increase from about €900 million per annum\n",
      "to €1,100 million throughout Europe by the 2080s; river flood costs to increase from €1,500 million to €2,500 million\n",
      "and wildfire costs to increase from €55 million to €79 million. However, damage caused by coastal floods, droughts and\n",
      "heatwaves is projected to increase by very large factors, including up to 20 to 50 times the present damage costs. Damage\n",
      "to critical infrastructure from coastal flooding was almost negligible during the baseline period (approximately €15 million\n",
      "per annum) but is projected to increase to €500 million per annum by the 2080s. Damage caused by droughts is projected\n",
      "to increase from about €450 million per annum to €15,000 million, while heatwave damage is projected to increase from\n",
      "about €370 million per annum to €18,000 million (Forzieri et al., 2018).\n",
      "Some current infrastructural risks should be significantly reduced as the climate warms. For example, pipe bursts due to\n",
